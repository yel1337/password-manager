# password-manager

  The project sole purpose is to learn the ins and outs of software developent cycle. 
  
  The point of having a Password Manager is to well, manage passwords and login credentials effienctly. With this project the goal is to create a built-in Password Generator inside the Password Manager wherein the password being generated can be linked to a login credential. Moreover, the Password Manager should be capable of offline use. Meaning, there will be no means of integrating the Password Manager to a cloud service or to any third-party services to serve its purpose. This decision can eliminate the posibilities users have concerns in terms of data security. However, making it offline doesn't make the Password Manager invulnerable from external or internal attacks therefore the one of project's top priorities is to minimize those possibilities that will negatively affect the software.

  The project will be free of use and will undergo legal procedures in distributing the software.
