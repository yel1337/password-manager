# password-manager

  This will be a personal project with a purpose to learn the C Programming Language.

  I came up to an idea to make a Password Manager with a built-in Password Generator which the password generated can be linked to a login credential. Moreover, the Password Manager should be capable of offline use. Meaning, there will be no means of integrating the Password Manager to a cloud service or to any third-party services. This decision can eliminate future user's concerns in terms of data security. However, making it offline doesn't make the Password Manager invulnerable from external or internal attacks therefore the project's top priority is to minimize those possibilities that will negatively affect the software.

  The project will be free of use and will undergo legal procedures in distributing the software.
